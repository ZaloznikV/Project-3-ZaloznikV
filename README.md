# Project 3: Predictive modeling

Databox company provided an anonymized and sampled dataset on their platform usage data. 
I decided to try to find best possible models for problems:
- can we predict if paying company will stop paying?
- can we predict if non-paying company will start paying?

 Data can be found [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/lNCqrUm1) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xlBq18Ljh9fZ_o_KXaFuMe4fId9waS3G/view?usp=sharing).
Data should be extracted into the working directory for reproducibility.

All the code is in jupyter notebook "predictive_modeling.ipynb". Just run it from start to finish to reproduce the results. 
All additional details are listed at the beginning of the notebook.

In repository are also some additional plots and calculations that were not included in report but were also calculated in the notebook.
